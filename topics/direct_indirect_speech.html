        <h1>Direct and Indirect Speech</h1>

        <p>When we communicate what someone else has said, we can use either direct speech or indirect speech (also called reported speech). Understanding the rules and differences between these two forms is essential for clear and accurate communication.</p>

        <h2>What is Direct Speech?</h2>
        <p>Direct speech repeats the exact words spoken by someone, using quotation marks. It presents the speaker's words exactly as they were spoken.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Sarah said, "I am going to the store."
        </div>

        <h2>What is Indirect Speech?</h2>
        <p>Indirect speech (or reported speech) reports what someone said without using their exact words and without quotation marks. It involves changes in pronouns, verb tenses, and time or place references.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Sarah said (that) she was going to the store.
        </div>

                <h3>Direct Speech</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uses quotation marks</li>
                    <li>Reports exact words spoken</li>
                    <li>Uses present tense if that was used originally</li>
                    <li>Preserves original pronouns (I, you, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Keeps original time and place references (now, here, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="key-box indirect-key">
                <h3>Indirect Speech</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>No quotation marks</li>
                    <li>Paraphrases what was said</li>
                    <li>Generally shifts verb tenses backward</li>

        <h2>Rules for Converting Direct to Indirect Speech</h2>

        <h3>1. Pronoun Changes</h3>
        <p>When converting from direct to indirect speech, pronouns often need to change based on the context and the reporter.</p>
        
        <div class="rule">
            <p><strong>Rule:</strong> Pronouns change according to the context of the reporting.</p>
        </div>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Direct Speech</th>
                <th>Indirect Speech</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"I am happy," he said.</td>
                <td>He said (that) he was happy.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"You are late," she told me.</td>
                <td>She told me (that) I was late.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"We will help you," they promised.</td>
                <td>They promised (that) they would help us/me.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"They have finished their work," he said.</td>
                <td>He said (that) they had finished their work.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>2. Tense Changes</h3>
        <p>One of the most important aspects of indirect speech is the backshift of tenses. When the reporting verb (said, told, asked, etc.) is in the past tense, the verb in the reported speech typically moves one tense back in time.</p>
        
        <div class="rule">
            <p><strong>Rule:</strong> When the reporting verb is in the past tense, shift the tense of the reported verb backward.</p>
        </div>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Direct Speech</th>
                <th>Indirect Speech</th>
                <th>Tense Change</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Present Simple: "I work here."</td>
                <td>He said (that) he worked there.</td>
                <td>Present Simple → Past Simple</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Present Continuous: "I am studying."</td>
                <td>She said (that) she was studying.</td>
                <td>Present Continuous → Past Continuous</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Present Perfect: "I have finished."</td>
                <td>He said (that) he had finished.</td>
                <td>Present Perfect → Past Perfect</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Past Simple: "I visited Paris."</td>
                <td>She said (that) she had visited Paris.</td>
                <td>Past Simple → Past Perfect</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Future (will): "I will help."</td>
                <td>He said (that) he would help.</td>
                <td>Future (will) → Conditional (would)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> If the direct speech contains a past perfect tense, it remains the same in indirect speech.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I had already eaten," she said. → She said (that) she had already eaten.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Exception:</strong> If the reported content is still true at the time of reporting or is a universal truth, the tense may remain unchanged.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "The Earth revolves around the Sun," the teacher said. → The teacher said (that) the Earth revolves around the Sun.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>3. Time and Place Reference Changes</h3>
        <p>Words that refer to time and place often need to change in indirect speech to reflect the different context.</p>
        
        <div class="rule">
            <p><strong>Rule:</strong> Adjust time and place references to reflect the perspective of the reporter.</p>
        </div>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Direct Speech</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>next week</td>
                <td>the following week / the week after</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <div class="example">

            <strong>Indirect:</strong> He said (that) he would see me the next day.
        </div>

        <h3>4. Modal Verb Changes</h3>
        <p>Modal verbs also follow specific patterns when changing from direct to indirect speech.</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Direct Speech</th>
                <th>Indirect Speech</th>

            <strong>Indirect:</strong> She said (that) she could swim.
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> 'Could', 'might', 'should', 'would', 'ought to', and 'used to' remain the same in indirect speech.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>5. Reporting Questions</h3>
        <p>When reporting questions, we use 'asked', 'inquired', 'wanted to know', etc., instead of 'said'. The word order changes to that of a statement, and we do not use question marks.</p>
        
        <div class="rule">
            <p><strong>Rule for Yes/No Questions:</strong> Use 'if' or 'whether' to introduce the reported question.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Direct:</strong> "Do you like coffee?" he asked.<br>
            <strong>Indirect:</strong> He asked if/whether I liked coffee.
        </div>
        
        <div class="rule">
            <p><strong>Rule for Wh-Questions:</strong> Keep the question word (what, where, when, etc.) and change word order to statement form.</p>

        <div class="example">
