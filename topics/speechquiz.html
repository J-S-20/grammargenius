                        <p><strong>Correct answer:</strong> When converting from direct to indirect speech, pronouns, time expressions, and usually tenses change.</p>
                        <p>This is the fundamental rule of converting direct to indirect speech - changes typically occur in pronouns (I → he/she), time expressions (today → that day), and tenses (present → past).</p>
